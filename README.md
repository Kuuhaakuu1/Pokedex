# Pokedex App

Pokedex is a mobile app for Android that displays information about different Pokemon species. The app allows users to browse through a list of Pokemon and view details such as the Pokemon's name, sprite, HP, attack, and defense stats.

The app was created by Omar Temsamani using Java and the Android Studio IDE. The app uses the following technologies and libraries:

- RecyclerView for displaying the list of Pokemon
- Picasso for loading images from URLs
- HttpsURLConnection for making API requests to the PokeAPI

## Credits

The app uses data and images from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).



## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I learned a lot about Android development, including:

- How to use RecyclerView to efficiently display a list of items
- How to load images from URLs using Picasso
- How to make API requests and handle JSON data using HttpsURLConnection
- How to use layout files to create user interfaces and organize app components
- How to handle user input and respond to user events
- How to debug and test Android apps on different devices and versions of Android
- How to manage project dependencies and use third-party libraries
- How to create a simple but functional mobile app from start to finish

Overall, this project was a great learning experience and gave me a good foundation in Android development. I look forward to building more apps and exploring new technologies in the future.
